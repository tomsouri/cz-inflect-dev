Topic: Automatic inflection in Czech

Keywords: automatic inflection, morphology, natural language generation, czech language

Task: The goal of this work is to implement a library for automatic inflection of czech nouns, focusing on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

The input is a czech noun in its base form (lemma) and optionally the morphological tag.

The output contains all possible forms of the given lemma (or the form corresponding to the given tag).

One of the sub-goals is creating reasonably large set of development and test data (at least 100 lemmata with inflected and manually checked inflected forms) for continuous evaluation during the process of creating and improving the models and testing the final models. Other sub-goal is implementing this testing and comparing the accuracy with some basic baselines and existing models.

The inflection model itself should be implemented in at least two ways, using different methods based on the data-driven approach.

Possible approaches for implementation of the model:
- simple retrograde approach (find the most similar word in the dictionary and inflect the given lemma according to its pattern)
- generate transcription rules
- generate the inflected form by characters

Possible algorithms of machine learning:
- SVM (Support Vector Machines)
- k-nearest neighbours
- feedforward NN (constant-length input, constant-length output, padded with empty characters)
- recurrent NN
- convolutional NN
- encoder-decoder architecture (using LSTM/GRU, Transformer, BERT)
- other deep-learning-based methods

Possible extensions:
- not only OOV, but all nouns
- not only nouns, but also other inflectable parts of speech
